#### The place

Stretching west from the Anglo-Welsh border, the Brecon Beacons are a rolling, wild landscape set within the 519 square miles (1,340 km2) of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The region's high point is Pen-y-Fan at 2,907 feet (886m), also the highest point in South Wales. Made for multi-day adventures on foot or bike, the area is also a dark sky reserve, perfect for watching the stars from a wild bivvy.

#### The adventure

Our weekend bikepacking trip followed the Taff Trail, a mainly traffic-free 55-mile (89km) route that begins in Cardiff and passes through towns rich in industrial and mining heritage before emerging into breathtaking mountain landscapes where waterfalls tumble down craggy hillsides and gleaming reservoirs nestle in the valleys. The trail ends in the town of Brecon, but. From here you can either reverse the route to Cardiff or continue onwards, following the peaceful Monmouthshire and Brecon canal to the pretty town of Abergavenny, where there’s a station and regular trains back to Cardiff. If you begin your ride in Brecon there’s also an outstanding loop that takes you all the way around Pen-y-Fan. Head out on the Taff Trail as far as Merthyr Tydfil before following bridleways and quiet lanes back north to Brecon.
