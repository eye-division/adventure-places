#### The place

Stretching west from the Anglo-Welsh border, the Brecon Beacons are a rolling, wild landscape set within the 519 square miles (1,340 km2) of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The region's high point is Pen-y-Fan at 2,907 feet (886m), also the highest point in South Wales. Made for multi-day adventures on foot or bike, the area is also a dark sky reserve, perfect for watching the stars from a wild bivvy.

#### The adventure

Our weekend bikepacking trip followed the Taff Trail, a mainly traffic-free 55-mile (89km) route that begins in Cardiff and passes through towns rich in industrial and mining heritage before emerging into breathtaking mountain landscapes where waterfalls tumble down craggy hillsides and gleaming reservoirs nestle in grassy valleys. The trail ends in the town of Brecon, a good place to stop and refuel, but we left it a little early and camped in the beautiful Usk Valley, finding the grassy hillsides bathed in golden evening sunlight as we arrived and pitched our tents. The following morning we set off west with the sun on our backs, picking up a branch of the Taff Trail and tracing a loop all the way around Pen-y-Fan on quiet lanes and bridleways. At Merthyr Tidfil we rejoined our outward route back to Cardiff.
