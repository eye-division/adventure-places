#### The place

Stretching west from the Anglo-Welsh border, the Brecon Beacons are a rolling, wild landscape set within the 519 square miles (1,340 km2) of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The region's high point is Pen-y-Fan at 2,907 feet (886m), also the highest point in South Wales. Well serviced by footpaths and bridleways they are made for multi-day adventures on foot or bike, and the area is also a dark sky reserve, perfect for watching the stars from a wild bivvy.

#### The adventure

Our bikes loaded with everything we'd need for a weekend's riding, four of us met just outside Brecon early on a Saturday morning. We begin by heading south on the Taff Trail, a mainly traffic-free 55-mile (89km) route between Brecon and Cardiff. The trail takes you through wonderfully varied landscapes with mountain-lined valleys, waterfalls, gleaming reservoirs and a final decent through towns rich in industrial and mining heritage to reach the sea at Cardiff Bay. We rode a circular route, following the Taff Trail as far as to the Llwyn-onn reservoir. Here we left the trail, winding along minor roads and trails north-west above the waterfall-filled valley of Ystradfellte and heading out into the wild upland of Fforest Fawr where we pitched for the night, the grassy valleys and hillsides flooded with golden evening light. In the morning we headed east, stopping at the National Park visitor centre for a coffee before picking up the Taff Trail back to Brecon.&nbsp;

#### The weather

Regular summer showers but with plenty of sunshine - thankfully dry overnight and we were even treated to a spectacular sunset and sunrise.

#### Eat, drink, sleep

Wild camping in England and Wales, with the exception of some parts of Dartmoor, is illegal without the landowner's permission. It is, however, tolerated in many of the National Parks, particularly those with large, mountainous areas, as long as it's done responsibly. In the Brecon Beacons the Camping on Farms leaflet lists farmers who offer occasional camping for a small fee - further details and a generally excellent article on wild camping in Britain can be found at&nbsp;[campsites.co.uk](https://www.campsites.co.uk/guides/wild-camping/wild-camping-in-england-and-wales){: target="_blank"}.

#### Kit

My plus sized hardtail mountain bike was much better suited to this route than my friends gravel bikes, the gravel was a bit big for them! If we'd stayed on the Taff Trail however they would have found it much easier than me. Bikepacking specific bags from [Ortlieb](https://www.ortlieb.com/us/products/bikepacking){: target="_blank"} allowed me to enjoy the riding on a responsive and balanced bike and kept my kit dry throughout the showers. Three of us slept comfortably in the [Vaude Invenio SUL 3](https://www.vaude.com/en-GB/Products/Activity/Best-in-Test/Invenio-SUL-3P?number=124861820){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;while Dave had more space but was colder on his own in a [Terra Nova Laser Comp](https://www.terra-nova.co.uk/tents-and-spares/all-tents/laser-competition-1-tent-ss16/){: target="_blank"}.
