#### The place

Dartmoor National Park covers 368 square miles of granite upland in central and southern Devon. It's a rugged, wild place with vast swathes of open moorland punctuated by distinctive tors - the exposed knuckles of prehistoric volcanic activity. Off the trails, much of the running is hard going, with tussocky grass, boggy valleys, and an often featureless landscape that can make navigation challenging. It's a wonderfully peaceful, atmospheric place to be, however, where wild ponies graze amidst stone circles and ruined settlements and the moss-covered remnants of ancient sessile oak woodland, pockets of temperate rainforest by definition, are a magical experience to explore.

#### The adventure

Dartmoor isn't known for its scrambling, but then neither is anywhere else in the sunny south-west. If you know where to look there are some fantastic easy scrambles ideal for a relaxed clamber on a summer's day or to spice up a winter run.

Dartmoor's tors are well-loved by local boulderers for their shapely granite features offering a range of problems from the classic V1 Shark's Fin at Hound Tor right up to the Green Room at Bonehill, a 3-star V12. There's also a wealth of running trails here, particularly on the moor's gentler eastern fringes.

#### The weather

Dartmoor has its own weather, often lying cloaked in a blanket of grey cloud when the English Riviera below is basked in sunshine - it all adds to the atmosphere of the place. Sunny days on the moor are well worth waiting for though, when you can see for miles across the rolling hills and pick out each distinctively-shaped tor as it appears on the horizon. We were lucky enough to have uninterrupted blue skies and sunshine, and a spectacular sunset as we finished the day with a wild camp, too.

#### Eat, drink, sleep

The excellent Rugglestone Inn at Widecombe with its resident turkeys, ducks and hens is a local favourite - it does get very busy on a sunny weekend. Home Farm cafe on the edge of the National Trust's Parke estate on the Bovey Tracey side of the moor serves great food and coffee all day and is family- and dog-friendly. The cafe also has a mobile unit at the Haytor car park, next to the National Park visitor centre.

#### Kit

Although most of the easy scrambles and clambers on Dartmoor are perfectly doable in a decent pair of running shoes, if we're aiming for something a bit trickier we'll wear technical approach shoes with sticky rubber soles like the [Scarpa Mescalito](https://www.scarpa.co.uk/approach/mescalito/){: target="_blank"} or [La Sportiva TX4](https://www.lasportiva.com/en/tx4-woman){: target="_blank"}. These are comfortable all day but offer great grip and feel when climbing.

On longer, more mountainous days, especially if we have heavy rucksacks, we'll go for stiff, lightweight mountaineering boots. These offer great support and protection combined with good grip on rock and the ability to comfortably stand on small edges. We're currently wearing the [Zamberlan Baltoro](https://en.zamberlan.com/product/4751366/1000-baltoro-gtx-r-trekking-boots-royal-blue-black){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;or the [Scarpa Charmoz](https://www.scarpa.co.uk/mountain/charmoz-od-wmn/){: target="_blank"}. The new generation of [Mutant packs](https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/gb_en/climbing){: target="_blank"} from Osprey are perfect for carrying everything we need for a long day's scrambling, with a narrower profile that works particularly well for inching through smaller spaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;
