#### The place

#### The adventure

Dartmoor isn't known for its scrambling, but then neither is anywhere else in the sunny south-west. If you know where to look, however, there are some fantastic easy scrambles ideal for a relaxed clamber on a summer's day or to spice up a winter run.

Dartmoor's tors are well known by local boulderers for their shapely granite features offering a range of problems from the classic V0 Shark's Fin at Hound Tor to the Green Room at Bonehill, a 3-star V12. There's also a wealth of running trails here, particularly on the moor's gentler eastern fringes.
