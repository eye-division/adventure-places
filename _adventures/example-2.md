  Dartmoor isn't known for its scrambling, but then neither is anywhere else in
  the sunny south-west. If you know where to look, however, there are some
  fantastic easy scrambles ideal for a relaxed clamber on a summer's day or to
  spice up a winter run.

#### The place

Dartmoor National Park covers 368 square miles of granite upland in central and southern Devon. It's a rugged, wild place with vast swathes of open moorland punctuated by distinctive tors - the exposed knuckles of prehistoric volcanic activity. Off the trails, much of the running is hard going, with tussocky grass, boggy valleys, and an often featureless landscape that can make navigation challenging. It's a wonderfully peaceful, atmospheric place to be, however, where wild ponies graze amidst stone circles and ruined settlements and the moss-covered remnants of ancient sessile oak woodland, pockets of temperate rainforest by definition, are a magical experience to explore.

#### The adventure

Dartmoor isn't known for its scrambling, but then neither is anywhere else in the sunny south-west. If you know where to look, however, there are some fantastic easy scrambles ideal for a relaxed clamber on a summer's day or to spice up a winter run.

Dartmoor's tors are well-loved by local boulderers for their shapely granite features offering a range of problems from the classic V1 Shark's Fin at Hound Tor right up to the Green Room at Bonehill, a 3-star V12. There's also a wealth of running trails here, particularly on the moor's gentler eastern fringes.
