Hiding in Glenbrittle cafe at the foot of the mighty Cuillin Ridge while the rain hammered at the windows it didn't feel like we'd picked the best day to take the kids up one of our favourite routes on Skye. Coire Lagan is a beautiful, shining dish of water, suspended high in a corrie surrounded by impressive, jagged peaks. The view across it, aligned with the blue sea beyond, is truly magical - like a perfect, wild infinity pool. The trail from Glenbrittle beach is wonderfully inviting, with plenty of rocks to climb and giant mountains beckoning from above, making it a great expedition for families, too.

Our plan was for all four of us, plus the dog, to make the ascent on the main path as far as Loch an Fhir-bhallaich. Sim and the kids would then turn left, descending via the loch and the Eas Mor waterfall to Glen Brittle Hut, while I'd carry on to the top and meet them somewhere on the way down. Eventually, amazingly, the rain stopped and the sun came out and we were ready to go.

The main path heads east from the cafe, straight up towards the towering mountains. If you're lucky enough to have a fine day, the views are glorious from start to finish, from the rugged skyline of the Cuillin across the valley and down to the beach and the glittering sea. The trail is winding and rough in places but there's plenty to keep children occupied, including little streams, rocky outcrops and regular stops to look down to the sandy bay and see how far they've climbed.

The path junction is marked by several large cairns, helpful on the way back down, particularly if visibility isn't so good. I was keen to get to the top so left them with snacks and set off up the steepening trail at a run. The final section is steep and pathless in places with a couple of hands-on moments, but that ever-deepening corrie draws you in as you climb. There's a brilliant moment when, after numerous false summits, you finally gain the wide, flat boulders that enclose the loch and it lies there, twinkling blue-green in the sun and vivid against its grey backdrop of scree and crag.
