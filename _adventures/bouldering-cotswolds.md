#### The place

Set within Snowdonia National Park, with Cadair Idris on its doorstep,&nbsp;[Coed-y-Brenin](https://www.beicsbrenin.co.uk/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;is the UKâ€™s first, and largest, dedicated mountain bike trail centre. If you're looking for excellent mountain biking there are miles of exceptional singletrack for experienced riders alongside family and intermediate trails perfectly suited to all abilities. A more recent addition, [Run Coed-y-Brenin](http://www.runcoedybrenin.com/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;boasts a fantastic range of dedicated, way-marked running trails from the 2.7-mile Sarn Helen to the challenging Half Marathon that features over 700 metres of ascent. Whether you're riding or running there are shops, hire centres and a cafe at the visitor centre and regular organised events from regular night runs to the popular Ultra Trail Wales.
