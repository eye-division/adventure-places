### The Place

Mull is the second-largest island in the Inner Hebrides, after Skye. Like so many islands it's a wonderful place to escape with a character completely different from the mainland. It is also surprisingly varied, perfectly-sized for exploring, with a mountainous interior topped by Ben More at 966 metres, many beautiful lochs and beaches and the colourful town of Tobermory, home to the island's only single malt distillery, at its northern tip. Rich in wildlife, Mull boasts 2,388 different species of plant and 261 species of bird. Around its 300 miles of coastline you might spot seals, otters, dolphins, minke whales and basking sharks.

Ardmeanach (meaning: middle promontory) lies on Mull's west coast: isolated, inaccessible by car and with a high, craggy headland at Burg, the peninsula's westernmost point. Viewed across the water from the Ross of Mull to the south, the cliffs, sculpted by waves and weather, drop in a series of giant steps to the sea below. This is a place that feels wild, ancient and untouched with few settlements and some fascinating geology to discover.
