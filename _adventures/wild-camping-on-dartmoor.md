### The place

Dartmoor National Park, stretching across southern and central Devon, is a perfect place for a fastpacking, wild camping, multi-day adventure. Although the higher ground usually sees some snow over the later winter months, the weather is often fairly mild through November and December. A Christmas or new year fastpacking adventure, spending the days exploring some of the moor's best trails and the nights beneath a clear, star-scattered sky, is one of the best ways we can think of to spend some quality time together over the festive period. Wild camping is permitted in many areas of Dartmoor as long as it's done respectfully, staying only dusk-till-dawn, well away from roads or settlements and without any adverse impact on people, land or wildlife. As the only place in England were wild camping is expressly permitted, this is a privilege that we all need to protect for the future. A wealth of information and guidance for wild campers, including where you can and can't pitch, can be found on the [National Park's website](http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/outdoor-activities/camping){: target="_blank"}.

### The adventure

Setting out early from the warmth of the in-laws' house on the eastern fringes of Dartmoor, we followed the long, winding track up onto open moorland. Our planned route took in a long loop, running all of both days and with a carefully-chosen wild camping spot at half way.

Although everything had been damp and grey when we left, as we reached the stacked granite boulders of Hound Tor we were greeted by a spectacular sunrise, flooding the valley and the rocks with magical red-orange light. We spent nearly half an hour just taking it all in before the sun vanished behind a bank of cloud and the familiar grey tones of the moor returned. On day one we ran past Jay's Grave before climbing to the long ridge of Hamel Down and admiring the awe-inspiring stone circle at Grimspound. Following a bridleway took us past the Warren House - a good place to stop for refreshments later in the day - before navigating vague sheep paths to the edge of Fernworthy forest. Taking our time and exploring as we went meant we arrived at the deserted ruins of Teignhead Farm, a perfect spot for a wild camp, just as dusk was starting to fall. Plentiful water from the nearby North Teign river and wonderful views to wake up to make this a favourite overnight spot. Day two took us on a rambling route back to Haytor. With the promise of a second clear night and the hope of another glorious sunrise we pitched for a second night in the shelter of boulders in the valley below with the music of the nearby brook to send us to sleep.

### The weather

Mild (for December) and sunny on day 1, grey and chilly on day 2 with an overnight frost. Two fine sunrises and a sunset.

### Eat, drink, sleep

Over a sunny weekend, wild camping completes the adventure, but if the weather's bad it could easily turn an enjoyable fastpacking trip into an epic slog. There's a great choice of excellent pubs for food, drink and accommodation on Dartmoor plus self-catering, 'official' campsites with warm showers and B&B options. We highly recommend the Rugglestone Inn for a local cider, Home Farm cafe at Parke, Ullacombe Farm near Haytor and also the cafe at Castle Drogo, overlooking the picturesque Teign Valley.

### Kit

Happily, the moor's still dry enough for trail shoes and there's a fair bit of hard-pack trail and also some quiet road along the route. A good balance of grip and cushioning was required so we went for the men's [Inov-8 Parkclaw 275](https://www.inov-8.com/parkclaw-275-mens-trail-running-shoes-green){: target="_blank"}s - comfortable, fairly grippy and, in bright green, a great colour for photos - and the excellent women's [Bushidos from La Sportiva](https://www.lasportiva.com/en/bushido-woman){: target="_blank"} - perfect for rocky, gravelly trails. For the overnights we took lightweight down sleeping bags and the brilliant [Vaude Invenio UL ](https://www.vaude.com/en-GB/Products/Tents/2-Person/Invenio-UL-2P){: target="_blank"}2-person tent, not the lightest but protective and with plenty of room for us and our packs.

Clothing that's fast drying and warm for its weight is essential for fastpacking trips and the [Outdoor Research Deviator Hoody](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/gb/en/womens/womens-jackets-vests/womens-synthetic-insulated-jackets/womens-deviator-hoody/p/2437781194008){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;worked perfectly, both for colder spells of running during the day and then over a midlayer and under a jacket for the evening. This is one of those rare items of kit that really doesn't have any faults - it's brilliantly versatile, with stretchy, breathable, thumb-looped sleeves and back panel; windproof and lightly-insulated front; three perfectly-placed pockets and a snug, fitted hood.
