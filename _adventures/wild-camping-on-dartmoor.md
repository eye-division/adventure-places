## The place

Dartmoor National Park, stretching across southern and central Devon, is a perfect place for a fastpacking, wild camping, multi-day adventure. Although the higher ground usually sees some snow over the later winter months, the weather is often fairly mild through November and December. A Christmas or new year fastpacking adventure, spending the days exploring some of the moor's best trails and the nights beneath a clear, star-scattered sky, is one of the best ways we can think of to spend some quality time together over the holiday period. Wild camping is permitted in many areas of Dartmoor as long as it's done respectfully, staying only dusk-till-dawn, well away from roads or settlements and without any adverse impact on people, place or wildlife. As the only place in England were wild camping is expressly permitted, this is a privilege that we all need to protect for the future. A wealth of information and guidance for wild campers, including where you can and can't pitch, can be found on the [National Park's website](http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/outdoor-activities/camping){: target="_blank"}.

## The adventure

Setting out early from the warmth of the in-laws house on the eastern fringe of Dartmoor, we followed the long, winding track up onto open moorland. Our planned route took in a long loop, 15 miles each day and with a carefully-chosen wild camping spot at half way. Although everything had been damp and grey when we left, as we reached the stacked granite boulders of Hound Tor we were greeted by a spectacular sunrise, flooding the valley and the rocks with magical red-orange light. We spent nearly half an hour just taking it all in before the sun vanished behind a bank of cloud and the familiar grey tones of the moor returned.
