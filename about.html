She is a qualified podiatrist with a master&rsquo;s degree in sport &amp; exercise medicine and a love of good books and great coffee.</p>
    <p><strong>Sim</strong> is a photographer, endurance athlete and environmentalist. He graduated in environmental earth science and has a climbing and mountaineering background. He is a qualified Leader in Running Fitness and has run, mountain biked and climbed around the country and explored the Alps, Iceland and the Himalayas both with the British Exploring Society and on solo adventures. He has completed marathons, ultras, iron-distance triathlons and adventure races and loves rocks and maps.</p>
    <p>We met through our mutual love of the great outdoors and have since been on many adventures together, from completing the Devon Coast to Coast Extreme adventure race (140 miles by bike, foot and kayak in 21 hours) to becoming parents to two free-range children. We&rsquo;re both experienced athletes and always up for a challenge; in 2015 we spent a year living wild under canvas in Britain.</p>
