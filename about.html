	<p><strong>Jen</strong> is a runner, writer and researcher and has completed over 50 marathons and ultras and the UK Ironman and Ironman 70.3 triathlons. She has a master’s degree in sport & exercise medicine and loves books and coffee.</p>

  <p><strong>Sim</strong> is an endurance athlete and environmentalist. He has travelled to the Himalayas, Iceland, Scandinavia and across Europe as an expedition leader and climber and is a qualified running group leader. He has completed marathons, ultras, iron-distance triathlons and adventure races and loves rocks and maps.</p>

  <p>We met through our mutual love of the great outdoors and have since been on many adventures together, from completing the Devon Coast to Coast Extreme adventure race (140 miles by bike, foot and kayak in 21 hours) to becoming parents to two free-range children. We’re both experienced athletes and always up for a challenge; in 2015 we spent a year living wild under canvas in Britain.</p>
