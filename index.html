      <p>Mine is painting with a passion. There is generally a strong narrative element, a story which is important to me. Rothko said: ‘There’s no such thing as a good painting about nothing’. I don’t want you to see what I see (impossible in any case), or feel what I feel – this is not Art as Dictatorship. I just want you to look and feel and ask questions. However as Edward Hopper said, ‘If I could say it in words there would be no reason to paint’. Maybe your question would be the prompt for another painting!</p>
