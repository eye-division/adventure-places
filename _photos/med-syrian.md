The third is called *Syrian boy dreaming* and is set in Sicily, with the mountains of that country and a reception/detention centre in the background. He is sleeping on a sun-lounger as there are not enough beds for all those arriving. As in the second painting, I wanted to depict an individual as it's hard to relate with Compassion to the numbers â€“ but here is a young lad, just like our children or grandchildren, who needs our understanding and help.
