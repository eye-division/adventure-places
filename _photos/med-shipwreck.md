I first stumbled across this by accident — I'd been impressed by a Turner painting of a shipwreck and wondered how contemporary artists treated the subject. did an internet image search (this was in November 2014) and what came up when I searched “Shipwreck today” were photos, and even videos – many taken by the Italian Coastguards. I just felt compelled to paint. I wanted to bring out the contrast between the Mediterranean as a beautiful coast that some of us might go on holiday with the horror of the loss of life and suffering of refugees. Hence, the first painting, *Shipwreck*.
