The second, of three teenagers in a fruit and vegetable warehouse, is called *The Smell of tomatoes*. once asked someone who had had a long and difficult journey to Britain which included a stay in Italy, what he most remembered about his time there and he said “The smell of tomatoes”. The teenagers (taken from a Save the Children/BBC image) are unaccompanied child refugees from Eritrea, two sisters and their friend. Save the Children estimate that the proportion of unaccompanied minors crossing the Seas to try to get to Europe is increasing, and may be as high as 25%. In this painting, I wanted to capture both hope and vulnerability.
