The Traveller wants to buy a study lanp. She has been given some directions, but they are not really very helpful and she sees someone who looks like a local. Unbeknownst to her, he is a Sufi teacher. She explains that she has been told that near this place, there is a lamp shop and she wiss certainly find a suitable light to help her study by. The Sufi replied:

'I happen to live near here, and I can direct you to it'. The Traveller said: 'I should be able to find it by myself. I have been given the directions, and I have written them down". The Sufi commented: 'Still, it would be easier for you to take further directions from a local resident, having got so far: especially because from here onwards it is difficult'.

The Traveller added: 'I trust what I have already been told, which has
brought me thus far. I cannot be sure that I can trust anything or anyone else'.

'So, although you once trusted the original informant, you have not been taught a means of knowing whom you can trust?' The Traveller did not ansvver this.

'And may I ask why you seek a lamp shop?' 'Because I want to buy
something that will help me study at night and so I want to buy a study
lamp'.

'You are correct in seeking a lamp shop, but there is a prerequisite, and
also a piece of information. I wonder whether you have given them any
thought.' 'What are they?' 'The prerequisite to studying by means of a
lamp is that you already know how to study'.

The Traveller became indignant but still asked: 'So, what is the Piece of
Information?' 'The piece of information is that the Lamp Shop is still
where it always was, but that the lamps themselves have been moved
somewhere else - a "Lamp Shop" may have two different meanings,
each opposed to the other. The meanings are: "A place where lamps
may be obtained", and "A place where lamps were once obtained but
which now has none".

They continued to argue in this fashion for some time , and then went
their separate ways. In fact, the Lamp Shop was just close by and not
hard to find at all. And they ignored the beautiful reflective pavement at
their feet too!
