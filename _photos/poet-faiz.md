##Beirut by Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1982)

Beirut, ornament of our world
Beirut, exquisite as Paradise’s gardens.
Those shattered mirrors once were
The smiling eyes of children.
Now are star-lit.
This city’s nights are bright, and luminous is Lebanon.
Beirut, ornament of our world.
Faces decorated with blood
Dazzling, beyond beauty.
Their elegant splendour
Lights up the city’s lanes.
And radiant is Lebanon.
Beirut, ornament of our world.
Every charred house, every ruin
Is equal to Darius’ citadels.
Every warrior brings envy to Alexander.
Every daughter is like Laila.
This city stands at time’s creation.
This city will stand at time’s end.
Beirut, the heart of Lebanon.
Beirut, ornament of our world.
Beirut, exquisite as Paradise’s Garden.
