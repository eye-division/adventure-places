The Traveller is in a strange land, perhaps one which is in the grip of civil war. She sees a child with a lamp — she collects lamps, is really quite obsessed by pretty and unusual lamps - and really likes this one.

She beckons the child over and tries to explain that she wants to buy the lamp but he doesn't seem to understand. She gets frustrated, even angry and begins to suspect that perhaps the child has stolen the light.

She asks him: 'VVhere did that light come from?'' He still doesn't answer and she asks again. This time, the child blows the light out and says: ‘There — the light has gone back to where it canne from!’
