The Sufi master Mullah Nasruddin was out in the street in front of his
house searching for something under a streetlamp.

The Traveller came by and she asked him: 'What are you looking for?'
'My house key', Nasruddin replied, 'I lost it'.

The Traveller joined him in looking for the key, and after a period of
fruitless searching, asked, 'Are you sure you lost it around here?'
Nasruddin replied, 'Oh, I didn't lose it around here. I lost it in my house'.

'Then why' the Traveller asked, 'are you looking for it over here?'
'Because', Nasruddin said, 'The light is so much better out here under
the street light'.
