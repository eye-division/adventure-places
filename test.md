##Training
My formal training has been a Foundation year in Leamington Spa, then much later, in my 30s, the Craft Materials course (HND equivalent) at Coventry Faculty of Art and Design. I intended to specialize in Jewelry – I come from a long line of jewelers – but Textiles was taught by the Head of the Art School, [Pat Shenstone](http://www.patshenstone.co.uk/Pat_Shenstone_ARTIST/Welcome.html) who was really inspiring, and I specialized in textile art, in particular, Islamic patterns. I consider Pat Shenstone to be a big influence still – in terms of there being a story to my art, and it being pro-woman, often turning myths and iconography around (see Mozambican Chess series, and <a href="/gallery/women-in-science/">Women in Medicine</a>). 
 
##Techniques
I constantly love to learn new techniques and would like to do more photography and film. **Any poets out there who want to collaborate on a film - do get in touch**. Currently, I mostly work in acrylics with mixed media elements – although occasionally I tackle the same subject in two or more media.  
I’m fascinated by the synergy between different art forms, especially poetry and painting, hence the <a href="/gallery/poet-in-exile/">Poet in Exile</a> series, and <a href="/gallery/various/">Buskers.

##Influences and Inspiration
* [Reinata Sadimba](http://www.africancontemporary.com/Reinata%20Sadimba%20Passema.htm) Mozambican sculptor, see my portrait of her as Creator Queen in the Mozambican Chess series   
* John Piper – for his use of colour  
* Turner – my *Websters Brickworks, Coventry* is roughly the same place as his view of *Coventry from the North West* (1830). And I was inspired by his paintings of shipwrecks to do a search ‘Shipwreck Today’ which resulted in *Shipwreck*, the first of the 3 <a href="/gallery/in-the-mediterranean/">In the Mediterranean series</a>.
