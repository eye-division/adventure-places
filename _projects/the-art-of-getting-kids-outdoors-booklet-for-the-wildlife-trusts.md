As parents to two young children we know how important it is to spend time together outdoors. But we also know how hard it can be to actually get through the doorâ€¦ Our aim in writing this booklet was to address some of the common challenges involved in spending time outdoors with young children and to provide some practical advice and inspiration, while keep everything fun and enjoyable - because that's how it should be!
