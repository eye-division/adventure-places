We were delighted to be asked to model and shoot the new Flint range from Aussie Grit Apparel after the brand won an award for its 3/4-length tights in Women's Running magazine. Our images appeared across the brand's website and social media and on a full page of the magazine.

The shoot took place on the chalk plains above Westbury white horse and Bratton Camp in Wiltshire on a glorious golden evening.
