  The National Trust's Amazing Family Adventures book is divided into challenge levels â€“ the earlier chapters are aimed at younger children whilst the end of the book is more adventurous!

  This book is packed with hints, facts and step-by-step guides to activities such as wild swimming, surfing and wilderness survival.

  Each activity suggests National Trust places to visit for an adventure with the whole family.
