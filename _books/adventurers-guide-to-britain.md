  We’re super excited to announce that our new book, *The Adventurer’s Guide to Britain*, is out now from Bloomsbury. It’s a collection of some of our very favourite adventures from right across the country, from surfing off John O’Groats and sea snorkelling on Harris to bikepacking the South Downs Way and a swimrun adventure around the Isles of Scilly. We have included 150 incredible experiences that showcase the best way to explore each area and you’ll find running, scrambling, swimming, kayaking, cycling and wild camping adventures to try. You’ll also find recommendations for places to eat, sleep and explore nearby. We reckon you’ll enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it
