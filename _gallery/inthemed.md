    description: "In the Mediterranean Syrian Boy Dreaming<br> The third is called Syrian boy dreaming and is set in Sicily, with the mountains of that country and a reception/detention centre in the background. He is sleeping on a sun-lounger as there are not enough beds for all those arriving. As in the second painting, I wanted to depict an individual as it's hard to relate with Compassion to the numbers – but here is a young lad, just like our children or grandchildren, who needs our understanding and help."

    description: "In the Mediterranean Shipwreck<br>I first stumbled across this by accident. I'd been impressed by a Turner painting of a shipwreck and wondered how contemporary artists treated the subject. I did an internet image search (this was in November 2014) and what came up when I searched 'Shipwreck' today were photos, and even videos many taken by the Italian Coastguards. I just felt compelled to paint. I wanted to bring out the contrast between the Mediterranean as a beautiful coast that some of us might go on holiday with the horror of the loss of life and suffering of refugees. Hence, the first painting, <em>Shipwreck</em>."

    description: "In the Mediterranean The smell of tomatoes<br> The second, of three teenagers in a fruit and vegetable warehouse, is called <em>The Smell of tomatoes</em>. once asked someone who had had a long and difficult journey to Britain which included a stay in Italy, what he most remembered about his time there and he said 'The smell of tomatoes'. The teenagers (taken from a Save the Children/BBC image) are unaccompanied child refugees from Eritrea, two sisters and their friend. Save the Children estimate that the proportion of unaccompanied minors crossing the Seas to try to get to Europe is increasing, and may be as high as 25%. In this painting, I wanted to capture both hope and vulnerability."

I began the first image at the end of 2014 in response to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean.
