  <p>We love books of all kinds and feel incredibly lucky to count writing them as our job. Over the past few years we've explored the length and breadth of the country researching and photographing incredible places and amazing adventures in the great British outdoors. Our first book, <em>Wild Running</em>, was published in 2014 by Wild Things Publishing. <em>Amazing Family Adventures</em> (National Trust) and <em>Day Walks in Devon</em> (Vertebrate) came out in 2017 and our latest book, <em>The Adventurer's Guide to Britain</em>, was published by Bloomsbury in 2018. We have a busy 2019 lined up with the fully-updated second edition of <em>Wild Running</em> due out in February and our second book in the <em>Day Walks</em> series, this time covering beautiful Cornwall, out in April.</p>
