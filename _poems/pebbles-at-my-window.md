##by Mario Benedetti

Sometimes joy throws pebbles at my window  
it wants to tell me that it’s there, waiting  
but I feel calm, I’d almost say centred.  
I’m going to keep anxiety in its hiding place  
and then stretch out, face towards the ceiling  
which is a position both alert and comfortable  
suitable for listening to the news and believing it.  
Who knows where my next steps will lead  
or when my story will be recorded?  
Who knows what advice I’ll make up  
and what excuse not to follow it?  
Don’t worry, I won’t gamble with an eviction  
or tattoo memory mixed with forgetfulness  
there’s much left to do and to leave unsaid  
and there are still grapes to fill our mouths.  
Don’t worry, I give in, I’m persuaded  
Joy doesn’t need to throw any more pebbles  
I’ll open the window.
