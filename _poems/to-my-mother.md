##TO MY MOTHER
Dearly I yearn for my mother's bread,  
My mother's coffee,  
Mother's brushing touch.  
Childhood is raised in me,  
Day upon day in me.  
And I so cherish life  
Because if I died  
My mother's tears would shame me.

Set me, if I return one day,  
As a shawl on your eyelashes, let your hand  
Spread grass out over my bones,  
Christened by your immaculate footsteps  
As on holy land.  
Fasten us with a lock of hair,   
With thread strung from the back of your dress.  
I could grow into godhood  
Commend my spirit into godhood  
If I but touch your heart's deep breadth.

Set me, if ever I return,  
In your oven as fuel to help you cook,  
On your roof as a clothesline stretched in your hands.  
Weak without your daily prayers,  
I can no longer stand.

I am old  
Give me back the stars of childhood  
That I may chart the homeward quest  
Back with the migrant birds,  
Back to your awaiting nest.
